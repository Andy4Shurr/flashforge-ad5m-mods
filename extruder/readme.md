# Files for extruder housing.
i try make model of extruder housing for my printer, because original was damaged with unclog tool. THIS MODEL IS UNTESTED, so if anyone send me feedback, i will be glad for that. original back plate should be fit to this.
Always use latest version. Older versions are only for reference and backup.
 

**Printing info (SLA):**

Printer: Anycubic photon (with mono upgrade from chitu)

Slicer: Chitubox Basic 2.3

Profile: Elegoo Mars 2 Pro, changed exposure time from 2.5s to 1.7s for accuracy

Resin: Creality Standard Resin

Be sure your SLA printer is calibrated for accuracy.

 

**Assembly notes:**

Use all parts from original extruder include screw for tension.

M3 threads for tension screw and fan must be tapped.

For fan use M3x16 screws with flat head, or use original screw (not needed tapped).


**Update 19.4.2025** - v4 - its fully function and its tested (load/unload filament) successfully, still untested in printing. still need small correction but now it is usable
