it need apache+php (like xampp), enabled socket module in php.ini. copy files (index.php and ff.php) to html folder and just open in browser:
>http://localhost/<path_to_files>/index.php?ip=<IP_PRINTER>

its simple, code need correction (i know, i am beginer). 
you can check temperature, progres of printing, webcam, and turn LED ON/OFF, pause, resume, cancel, home.
