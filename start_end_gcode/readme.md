This start gcode makes auto bed mesh leveling before print. 
start.gcode is my version of start gcode for leveling before print.
start2.gcode is similiar like factory process of leveling before print.

Its usefull when you sending files over wifi directly from OrcaSlicer 2.0.0dev [(thanks to iherbak)](https://github.com/iherbak/OrcaSlicer) and want leveling before print.
